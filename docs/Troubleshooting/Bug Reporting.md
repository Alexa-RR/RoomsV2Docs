# Bug Reporting

If you encounter a bug in Rec Room Studio, the best way for it to be addressed is to submit a bug report via the integrated tooling. By reporting a bug via the tool, we get access to important information to assist us tracking down a potential solution to the reported issue. 


### Submitting a bug report

It is important to submit a bug report quickly after a bug is encounted. The longer the period of time between witnessing a bug and submitting a bug increases the likelihood that pivotal information is lost. 

1. From the 'Rec Room Studio' menu, select 'Report a bug'

### Report a bug fields

Let's look at each field

#### Subject

> #### examples 
>*good: Upload and Build fails after using the Play button*  
>*good: Cannot open room. Error "Invalid Object detected"*
