# Testing and Publishing Rooms

## Testing Your Room

If you want to try out your work, but you’re not ready to build your room and save your changes on RecNet, then you’ll want to use the “Play Room” options located within the Rec Room Studio menu.

### “Local” Tests
“Local” refers to playing your Rec Room Studio room within the Rec Room Client you installed with Rec Room Studio- on the same computer you’re running Unity! When the play mode is set to Local, clicking on the Play button will launch Rec Room on your computer. Then it will send you to the latest version of your room on your computer. When in Local Play mode, select “Send to Studio” to save changes you make with the Maker Pen to the room.

### “Remote” Tests
“Remote Tests” refer to playing your Rec Room Studio room on another device (PC, phone, VR headset) - without actually building your room save on Rec.net servers.
Note: In order to run a remote test for a particular platform you need to have installed the Unity Build package for that platform. If you want to run a remote test on an iPhone you need to have the iOS Unity Editor build package installed.

### Publishing Your Room
Publishing Your Room is not allowed until Zizzy or mt1a gives approval. Message Zizzyphus#1029 or mt1a#1176 on Discord with the name of your room for review when you are ready to publish it.
