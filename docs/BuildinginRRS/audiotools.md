# Audio Tools

To utilize the existing audio channels in Rec Room, there are special Mixers generated in Rec Room Studio projects.

:::info
You do not need to add an Audio Listener to your scenes. The Audio Listener is handled by Rec Room in the game client
:::

The Audio Mixer in a Rec Room Studio project scene comes with 3 Master Mixers that correlate to the named in-client audio channels: Ambience, Music, and Sounds. These Master Mixers act as the sound input for respective named channels in-client.

:::danger
Do not remove, rename, or reroute these Mixers. Only the Ambience, Music, and Sounds Master Mixersâ€™ output will be heard in the game.

## Adding Audio Sources to your scene

You can add Audio to your scene by either:

<details>

<summary>Adding Audio Source objects directly to the scene hierarchy</summary>

Select the GameObject menu or right-click in the hierarchy, then select Audio>Audio Source

</details>

<details>

<summary>Adding Audio Source components to Unity Objects in the scene</summary>

Select Add Component>Audio Source
<img src="/img/addaudio2.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Adding Audio Source components to Rec Room Studio Objects via the Prefab Editor</summary>

Select Add Component>Audio Source
<img src="/img/addaudio2.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

</details>

- Set the output of each Audio Source used in your scene and prefabs to either:
  - One of the Ambience, Music, or Sounds Master Mixers
  - Additional Mixers you have added that will output to the Ambience, Music, or Sounds Master

When adding effects, you can add them either directly to the Ambience, Music, or
Sounds Master Mixers, or to additional Mixers you make in the project.

:::tip
It is recommended to add scene or area effects to custom Mixers you make
because Mixer settings are carried across all scenes in a project.
