# Post Processing

In Unity, post-processing refers to a set of effects and techniques that are applied to the final rendered image of a game or application, after the rendering pipeline has already completed its work.

The post-processing effects can help to enhance the visual quality of the game, add atmosphere, or simply provide a unique look and feel to the game. Some common examples of post-processing effects include bloom, motion blur, depth of field, color grading, and lens distortion.
