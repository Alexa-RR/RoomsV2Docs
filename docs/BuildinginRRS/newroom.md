## Make changes to the room

Do all the usual Unity stuff –add 3D objects, terrain, audio, etc. There’s so many things you can do, and a few you can’t. Check the [Rec Room Studio Known Issues](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nHt6edlO5cwWq6D7iutzXKAyhiKQ5VdcNg8ZIvjbgeE/edit) list for details on specific tools.
