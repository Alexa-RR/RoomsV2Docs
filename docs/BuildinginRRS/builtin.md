# Using Built-In Rec Room Objects

:::info
Built-in Rec Room Objects are all of the props, chips, components that exist in-game within the Maker Pen Palette. All of these objects can be browsed, placed, and saved into a room directly within Rec Room Studio.
:::

## Finding built-in Rec Room Objects
In the Unity Project Window, navigate to Packages/Rec Room Studio Authoring Content/Resources/Prefabs
:::tip
if you canâ€™t see this folder, select the eye icon in the upper right of the Project window to show hidden folders

:::tip
You can also search for these built-in objects (if you know the name) by setting the Unity Project Window Search filter dropdown to In Packages instead of In Assets

## Dragging a Rec Room Object prefab into the scene view or hierarchy view
As soon as you drag a Rec Room Object prefab into the scene it will appear in the Maker Pen Scene hierarchy (the orange-colored one).

Rec Room Objects will never appear in the Unity scene hierarchy (white and blue)

Rec Room Objects can be transformed and configured in the Inspector Window. Just select the object in the Scene View or Hierarchy Window to open that object in the Inspector Window.
