# Video Player
import ButtonLink from '@site/src/components/ButtonLink'

## Applying
**If you would like to use the RRS / Unity video player component in any of your rooms - you, or a co-owner on your room, will need to be approved.**
<ButtonLink title="Press here to apply" link="https://forms.gle/dadirReXWd97C63q9"/>


:::info
**If you know that you already have screenshare approval please do not apply.** Screenshare approval and video player component approval are the same thing. If you would like to check if you have screenshare / video player approval already you can follow the [instructions here](https://recroom.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4524184817687-Desktop-Screen-and-Audio-Sharing-Tools) and look for the 'Desktop Sharing Screen prop' in your Maker Pen Palette.
If you have that prop in your palette, you are already approved.
