# Texture Import Tool


You can modify the format of a texture on each platform separately to optimize your room’s download size and performance. To do so:

First, select your textures you want to modify the resolutions of in the project explorer tab

In the Texture Import Settings tab, select “Override default max texture sizes” and choose the resolution you want for each platform type. Quest headsets go under the Android category.
