# Buildingd, Testing and Publishing Rooms

In this section, we will go over Saving and testing your room
## Before you can test out your room, you must place down a Welcome Mat
Welcome Mats are “Built-in Rec Room Objects” that tell Rec Room where players should spawn when they load your room.

- Drag a (Welcome Mat) prefab from the Unity Project Window into your Scene View or Hierarchy Window. Use the Legacy Welcome Mat if your rooms’s settings aren’t enabled for beta content.  For more information look at [Using Built-In Rec Room Objects](/BuildinginRRS/builtin.md)

## Build your room
Select the “Upload & Build” button from the Rec Room Studio window
![buildroom](/img/buildroom.png)
:::danger
**Don’t close the Build This Room window until building has completed!**
:::
Now wait a few minutes for your build to complete (usually 5-10 minutes). 
:::tip 
You can view progress information in the Build on Rec.net area of the Rec Room Studio window.
:::
Now that your build has completed you can load your room in Rec Room on any platform.  If you were already sitting in your room you will need to load the room save you just created in Rec Room Studio to see your changes. To do that, go to your watch> This Room>select the back circle icon to open the Load Save menu>select the latest save (top of the list).

## Testing Your Room
