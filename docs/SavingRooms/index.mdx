# Testing and Publishing Rooms

In this section, we will go over Saving and testing your room
## Before you can test out your room, you must place down a Welcome Mat
Welcome Mats are “Built-in Rec Room Objects” that tell Rec Room where players should spawn when they load your room.

- Drag a (Welcome Mat) prefab from the Unity Project Window into your Scene View or Hierarchy Window. Use the Legacy Welcome Mat if your rooms’s settings aren’t enabled for beta content.  For more information look at [Using Built-In Rec Room Objects](/BuildinginRRS/builtin.md)

## Build your room
```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```


### Publishing Your Room
Publishing Your Room is not allowed until Zizzy or mt1a gives approval. Message Zizzyphus#1029 or mt1a#1176 on Discord with the name of your room for review when you are ready to publish it.
