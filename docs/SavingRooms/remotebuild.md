# Remote build

“Remote Tests” refer to playing your Rec Room Studio room on another device (PC, phone, VR headset) - without actually building your room save on Rec.net servers.
Note: In order to run a remote test for a particular platform you need to have installed the Unity Build package for that platform. If you want to run a remote test on an iPhone you need to have the iOS Unity Editor build package installed.
